#### Course Timing: 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM (2-hour session)

#### Course Satisfaction: 90.0%

#### Satisfaction Calculation:
- a people are very satisfied (5 points)
- b people are satisfied (4 points)
- c people are neutral (3 points)
- d people are dissatisfied (2 points)
- e people are very dissatisfied (1 point)

Therefore, the average satisfaction score is calculated as: 
(a * 5 + b * 4 + c * 3 + d * 2 + e * 1) / (a + b + c + d + e)
Generally, a score above 3 indicates good satisfaction. It can also be expressed as a percentage, for example:
((a * 5 + b * 4 + c * 3 + d * 2 + e * 1) / (a + b + c + d + e)) / 5 * 100%
